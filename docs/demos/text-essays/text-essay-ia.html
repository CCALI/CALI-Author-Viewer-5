      Contractor contracts with Owner to build a stone wall around three equal sides of Owner's property for $25,000. When Contractor has completed one side at a cost to Contractor of $10,000, Owner breaches and tells Contractor not to finish. An appraiser puts the value of the wall that was built at $5,000, but Owner does not like it and would have only paid $2,000 for it.
