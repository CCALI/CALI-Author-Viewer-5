      To conclude, let's reconsider the holding in the Wyman-Gordon case, in which the plurality suggested that agencies should not be allowed to create their own quasi-notice and comment procedures to be applied in adjudicative proceedings (e.g. , by inviting interested entities, who are not parties to the litigation, to submit comments on the proposed rule), and then use those procedures to create a rule to be applied only prospectively. In light of the fact that the Court routinely permits administrative agencies to adopt rules adjudicatively, and even allows them to apply those rules retroactively (in the sense that the rules might be applied to pre-existing facts in the adjudicative proceeding before the agency), does the Wyman-Gordon plurality's suggestion (that an agency should not articulate an adjudicative rule for prospective application only) make sense?
