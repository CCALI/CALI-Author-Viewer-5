You are, however, free to make any other submenu a <U>Click on Image</U> page.) Imagine a literal map to whole sections of your lesson. A click on one part of the map could lead the student to certain parts of your lesson. The Index for this sample lesson was created using <U>Click on Image</U> pages. </P><P>However there are two problems with this approach:</P><P>1. Regular menu pages have buttons which change color to show which menu topics the student has clicked already and which she has yet to explore. Click on Image pages don't.</P><P>2. Menu pages are used to build the &quot;tree&quot; of pages which a student can look at using the Contents button in the toolbar. If you use Click on Image pages instead of menu pages, the structure of your Book won't be properly represented in the Contents.</P><P>For these reasons, we recommend using Click on Image pages <B>as well as</B> regular menus, not instead of them, as this sample Book does.</P><P>To jump straight to the Index, click <A HREF="jump://Index">here</A>.</P><P>To jump straight to the <U>Click on Image</U> sample pages, click <A HREF="jump://Click on Image 1">here</A>.</P></TEXT> <MAPPER ID="1" BOUNDS="54,56,109">  <BRANCH KIND="18" NAME="Links" DEST="" BOUNDS="92,104,33"/> </MAPPER></PAGE>

The student will receive the particular feedback that you assign to each segment. This gives you the opportunity to address those students that over- or under-estimate the amount of damages, as well as those who estimate correctly.</P><P>Answer the question below to familiarize yourself with this page type. Try to elicit all six responses from the program by moving the slider to various positions and then checking your answer.</P><P>An elderly grandmother orders a cup of steaming Joe from the drive-through window of a popular fast-food establishment.

Click on View/Font in the toolbar above.</P><P>Now that we're set, let's continue with this introduction.</P><P>The various page types allow you to ask students particular kinds of questions or present particular kinds of information. For example, the <U>Multiple Choice</U> page type allows you to ask students multiple choice questions, and the <U>Book</U> page type (of which this page is an example) allows you to present students with text and a picture, animation, video or audio.</P><P>The most effective way to use the various page types offered by CALI Author is to actually use those page types as students will use them in your lesson. Before constructing your lesson, you should understand generally how the various page types work.

Lessons built with CALI Author are arranged by menus and sub-menus. You used the Main Menu of this sample lesson to access this Introduction.</P><P>We have categorized the page types offered by CALI Author. Some page types may fall into more than one category but were categorized only by their main feature. As you work through the sample lesson, the menu categories should give you a general idea of what the page types below each menu category offer. Later, when constructing your own lesson, you may find the menu system useful to identify certain functions that you need. For example, you may want to include a picture in your lesson. You could select the menu category that contains pictures and quickly explore all those page types that utilize graphics.</P><P><B>Index</B></P><P>We have also created an Index of page types. You can access this Index by clicking on the last button of the Main Menu. You will find all of the page types listed in the Index. To quickly access a page type, you need only to click on the page name. You may find the Index useful to remind yourself of how particular pages work without having to go through the hierarchy of menus.</P><P><B>Final note</B></P><P>The best way to use this lesson is to actually attempt to answer the sample questions. We have used a combination of legal and non-legal questions with a sprinkling of humor to make this easier to do.

Press the button now. <B>Notice</B> two things: (1) You may not have heard anything when you pressed the play button. Why? Your computer must have the right equipment for you to hear the sound clip, including a sound card and speakers. If you don't have the equipment, you can't hear the sound. Students using your lesson may be in the same predicament. Not everyone has the right equipment, so not everyone will be able to hear your sound clip. (2) When you clicked the play button, text appeared in the box below. If you actually heard the sound clip, you should recognize this text as a transcript of what Groucho said in the sound clip. The transcript box partially alleviates the problem in (1). At the very least, students without the right sound equipment will be able to read a transcript of the sound clip. When you construct your <U>Picture and Sound</U> pages, you will enter the text for the transcript yourself. Your transcript text will also allow hearing impaired students to enjoy your lesson, and it will allow all students to copy the words of the speaker and paste them into another Windows program.</P><P>Keep a couple of things in mind when constructing your <U>Picture and Sound </U>pages:</P><P>1. <B>Necessary and proper sound</B> </P><P>How necessary is the sound clip you are supplying? How effective is it as a source of information? Does the clip offer the student something she can't get another, better way?</P><P>For example, consider the sound clip we have included on this page. The clip you heard (or maybe only read) contains the voice of Groucho Marx. Let's assume, for the moment, that Groucho Marx is relevant to our subject matter. Why is this sound clip valuable? What does it offer to students? This sound clip is valuable because it offers material from a primary source. This sound clip echoes the voice of the actual and legendary Groucho Marx. Hearing his voice is much more effective than simply reading a quote. Those of you without the proper sound equipment can appreciate this. </P><P><B>Bottom line </B>: Include sound clips that will offer an experience students can not easily gain elsewhere.</P><P>2. <B>Sound file format</B></P><P>CALI Author uses sound files in the WAV format.</P><P>3. <B>Graphic File Formats</B></P><P>CALI Author can read several file formats for graphics: GIF, JPEG, PNG.</P><P>GIF files are stored more efficiently and take up less room on disks. The owners of the GIF patent, however, have been cracking down and its usage has been declining of late.</P><P>JPEG and PNG files are fast becoming the new, free standards - especially due to the popularity of the World Wide Web.</P><P>If you have graphics files that you wish to use with your lesson or need to be converted, <A HREF="popup://Click on Image 3 (CALI)">contact CALI </A>and we'll assist you.</P><P>4. <B>Graphic Size</B> </P><P>Try to keep your picture to a relatively small size.</P><P>Note: This page illustrates a problem common to interactive lessons: how much text should you include on a screen.

Consider these characteristics of the video clip: (a) The clip is historically significant, capturing a moment of turmoil in U.S. history. (b) The clip provides the student with material from a primary source. This isn't a clip of someone talking about the riots; this is a clip of the riots themselves.
